# Intro
### 2022-03-28

Hi there! I'm Focus, better known as Devin. I'm a 16 year old (at the time of writing) developer with a heavy passion for programming, hacking and learning new things. I also actively participate in competitive programming and CTFs. My current interests are in backend and game development but I'm always open try new things. I've been interested in programming since I was a kid and I've always loved it. My goal is to pursue a career in sofware development and research. This blog will be the home to any CTF writeups, tutorials or research related to hacking and programming.
